# Brizo Javascript UI

All JS UI code is separated to this directory. If you're developing the UI you should set your working directory here.

## Setup


### Node version

You should use the latest stable version of Node `6.9`. You can use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install a separate version of node if neccessary. With NVM installed you can run
```sh
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

and the correct version will be used.

### Dev server

After install dependencies with `npm install` you can run the development server that will watch for changes and re-compile:
```sh
$ npm run start
```
